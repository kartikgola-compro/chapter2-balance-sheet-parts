Intangible assets are long-term assets that convey special rights, such as the exclusive right to produce or sell an invention (patent) or book (copyright), or the symbol or image of a distinctive brand (trademark).

Intangible asset: An asset with no physical form that is valuable because of the special rights it carries.
