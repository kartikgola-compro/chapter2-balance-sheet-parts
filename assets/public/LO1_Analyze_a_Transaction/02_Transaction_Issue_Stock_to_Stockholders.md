## Let’s take a close look at this transaction above following these steps:

**Step 1: Identify the accounts and account type**. Each transaction must affect at least two accounts but could affect more than two. The two accounts involved in this transaction *are Cash (Asset)* and *Common Stock (Stockholders’ Equity).*

**Step 2: Decide if each account increases or decreases**. Remember to always view this from the business’s perspective, not from the stockholders’ or customers’ perspective. *Cash increases*. The business has more cash than it had before. *Common Stock increases*. The business received a $20,000 contribution and issued stock.

Step 3: Determine the impact on the financial statements. The *balance sheet* reflects a $20,000 increase to the asset, Cash, and to stockholders’ equity, Common Stock. *The statement of cash flows, financing,* is increased by $20,000.
